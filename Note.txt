Stuff to be added
    Restriction on audio size(not yet added)
    - 1 song 40mb at max (1 min of .wav[44.1khz, 16-bit] ~ 10mb)
        File size – WAV files are large. A stereo, CD quality recording (44.1khz, 16-bit), works out at 10.09 MB per minute. 
        Moving up to 48kHz 24-bit stereo (which will improve both the frequency range and the available dynamic range) will increase file size to 16.48 MB per minute.
